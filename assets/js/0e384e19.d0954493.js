In 2022, it is estimated that between 690 and 783 million people suffered hunger in the world (FAO, 2023). These estimations help infer that the world is far from achieving the UN's sustainable development goal of no hunger by 2030. Moreover, food security today is not a question of food scarcity, but rather a by-product of poverty and socio-ecnomic inequality in developing nations (Boliko, 2019). A way to tackle poverty in these countries is by boosting the growth of commodity (cash) crops."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"deforestation",children:"Deforestation"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Cashew crops in Africa have become one of the main cash crops of the region. The continent produces more than half of the raw cashew nut that is produced globally and accounts for 90% of the raw cashew nut exports in the world (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, 2021). These figures show the important influence that cashew crops have in African countries\u2019 economies. Especially, due to the fact that cashew is mainly grown by smallholders. Nevertheless, the recent growth of cashew crops in these regions has, in some cases, been at the expense of the environment. In fact, commodity crops expansion represents one of the primary drivers of deforestation in tropical countries (DeFries et al., 2010). For the case of cashew plantations, in Benin it has been estimated that between 2015 and 2019 the growth of cashew plantations in protected areas has increased by 55% (Yin et al., 2023).

These new policies aim to lower the emissions of greenhouse gases associated with agriculture, forestry and other land uses (AFOLU), which represent between 20 and 24 % of the global emissions (OECD, 2021).

Novel global approaches to monitor FLU using deep learning models have been conducted, however the results still show that regional models exhibit better results (Masolele et al., 2021).
